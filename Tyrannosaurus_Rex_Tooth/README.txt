# Summary

The notorious "king of the dinosaurs" had massive teeth.  Each were approximately 11 inches long and comprised of solid bone.  Because of their unique shape, this tooth was efficient in not only tearing meat off prey, but also crushing the bones of other dinosaurs.

This is a basic scan of a basic Tyrannosaurus Rex replica tooth.  It's not heavily detailed, but the overall shape/appearance matches the original scan at the bare basic level.

I have already used this scan to make miniature T. rex teeth and place them into a large sculpture of the dinosaur and given them away as prizes for students/kids who guess dinosaur questions right.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerBot
Printer: MakerBot Replicator (5th Generation)
Rafts: Yes
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
While it's definitely not required, It's not a bad idea to print with supports.  There are gaps at the bottom of the tooth that might make it difficult to print.
